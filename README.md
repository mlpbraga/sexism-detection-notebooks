# Sexism Detection

This repository has the implementation of a sexism detection research, using a dataset built using the https://sexismo.app.vercel site.

The dataset can be found at `/data/labeled-comments.csv`.

The file `sexism-detection.ipynb` contains all the feature selection, training and testing implementation. 

The file `baseline.ipynb` has the implementation of a hate speech detection work made by Davidson et al. [1] and the file `bert.ipynb` implements the [BERT model](https://github.com/google-research/bert), to compare results with the current work.
